# mars-sim-tools
These Python scripts assist in preparing data prior to a release:

tsv2xml (landmarks) converts a generated list of Martian landmarks from USGS to a simulation-compatible format, and adds human artifacts from Wikipedia and Google Mars.

htmlgenerate generates HTML5 files for the inline user guide based on the XML files in the project.

transition is a simple percentage calculator to give us incentive to migrate faster from Swing to JavaFX. It doesn't change the source or data files in any way.

MSP is on Sourceforge for the time being: http://mars-sim.sourceforge.net but under migration to GitHub pending compatibility with SVN clients.
