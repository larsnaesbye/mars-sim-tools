tsv2xml (landmarks) converts a generated list of Martian landmarks from USGS to a simulation-compatible format, and adds human artifacts from Wikipedia and Google Mars.

htmlgenerate generates HTML5 files for the inline user guide based on the XML files in the project.

transition is a simple percentage calculator to give us incentive to migrate faster from Swing to JavaFX.
